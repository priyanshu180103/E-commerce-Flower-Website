# E-commerce-Flower-Website

This is my big first project where I have creadted the front end part of a e-commerce flower website. I have mostly used Html & Css here and little bit of Javascript .
I have created this project from the scratch with my own creativity. Once you go through my source code files of html and css you can have clear idea about them and I have separate the 
sections for better understanding. 
Here is the link of my Website:   .
Hope you will like it.
