# E-commerce-Flower-Website

This is my first  e-commerce project, here I have created the front end part of a e-commerce flower website. I have mostly used Html & CSS here and little bit of Javascript .
I have created this project from the scratch with my own creativity. Once you go through my code files of html and css you can have clear idea about them and 
I have separate the sections for better understanding.
